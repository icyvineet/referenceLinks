^[a-zA-Z\\s]*$
where ^ is start of string and $ represents end of string.

You can also extend such regex to check the string size. Let's say if you want allow minimum 5 characters and maximum 20 characters

^[a-zA-Z\\s]{5,20}$
However, because whitespace \\s can be not just space-bar character, but also other charactes, such as new-line, tab, etc., you may want to limit this just to real space-bar characters using

 ^[a-zA-Z ]{5,20}$
Additionaly, you might want to limit multiple space characters to be used in sequence. If so, use

^(?!.* {2,})[a-zA-Z ]{5,20}$`
You might want string always to start and end with non-space characters. To add such feature go with

^(?=.{5,20}$)(?!.* {2,})[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z ]*[a-zA-Z]$
